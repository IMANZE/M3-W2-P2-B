 In this page you will have a short biography section about yourself, the top albums of your life, 
the worst album you ever listened to and everything related to the music you love.

 

ASSIGNMENT RULES

The project must be pushed to a new repository and linked in EduFlow.
You can google / use StackOverflow BUT we suggest you to use just the material and documentation provided.
Test the various screen sizes by shrinking and expanding the view with the developer tools / device emulator of the browser.
Use Bootstrap4.6 classes to create the grids when needed.
Use container > row > col in this order to achieve a great responsive layout.
NOTE:
There's no particular rule for how it should look like, as long as it's responsive it's ok. Get creative!
Spend some time surfing the web researching the best way of representing the albums you love.
Could be the Amazon way, the Spotify or Apple music way or any other music collection out there.

 

tip: finish the structure and responsiveness first, and only after spend time on the details.


EXERCISES:

1) You are going to create an album card component that you are going to reuse in the page. Bootstrap will give you pre-made components for cards and images. You can choose to start with one of them and customize it or create your CSS styles from scratch for a card with these elements:  

the card element
the album cover image
the album title
the album group / artist / dj
the album genre
the album duration
NB: make sure to apply the same rules to every album component you display in the page to have them looking consistently similar.

 

2)  Implement a navigation bar using the bootstrap component.

     This navigation bar must link every section in your page.

 

3) Create a responsive section for your favourite albums.

     In this section you should have:

4 albums per line when the screen is very large
3 albums per line on a tablet view (or a smaller viewport)
2 albums per line on a small screen
4)  Create a section for the album reviews.

      Pick one of your favourite albums, and create a section with:

A big cover Image
Title
Band
Duration
Genre
Tracklist ( in a table, check the bootstrap component for it ) 
... And whatever you think it's interesting about it!
5) Worst album list! Choose the albums you dislike or some you think are overrated and list it in this "hall of shame" chart!


6) Just covers! Create a tapestry of album pictures. Just images in a grid layout without any space between them (make sure every image has the same height). Put at least 20 cover images to have a nice tapestry effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.

 

EXTRA) Add a button to each section. By clicking on it, the section body appears (if hidden), or disappears (if visible).

hint: look for a bootstrap component that can handle the job for you. You can always rely on DOM manipulation if you can't find it
